The datasets from CP4IM, where the link is https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CP4IM/datasets/, which are in format '.txt' in folder ./datasetCP4IM.

The datasets binarized are in the folder ./datasetCP4IMpure, which are in format '.csv'.

The datasets binarized in folder ./datasetCP4IMpureBad are used in AdaBoost integration.

The method of binarlizing the non-binary feature is the "one-hot" encoding, which means creating a new binary feature for every possible value of each feature. The name format of new feature is f_o_v, where "o" is the index of original non-binary feature, and "v" is the value of this non-binary feature.

The way of deciding all possible values for each feature is to scan the whole dataset, and summarize all possible values presented. 

The file "summary.sum" is the summary of information for all datasets in this folder.
